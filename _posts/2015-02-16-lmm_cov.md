title: '[FaST-LMM] fastlmm/inference/lmm_cov.py, part 1'
---

This post starts the series devoted to studying FaST-LMM source code located 
[here](https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/FaST-LMM).

In these series, 'thesis' refers to the publication 'Linear mixed models for genome-wide association studies' (C. Lippert)

First of all, some definitions are to be provided:

* $\gamma$ is the ratio $\sigma^2_g / \sigma^2 $ of the variance parameters (genetic variance and level of environmental noise, respectively; see thesis 2.2);
* $ K $ - genetic similarity matrix, 'that quantifies the genetic relationship between individuals based on the causal loci' (also thesis 2.2);
* $ S = I - XX^\dagger $ (thesis 3.1.1)

The working horse is `LMM` class, versions of which can be found in as many as three files - `lmm2k.py`, `lmm.py`, and `lmm_cov.py`.
They are all similar.  The latter is more recently updated, but some of docstrings are not up-to-date.

Nevertheless, let's start from `lmm_cov.py`.
One of the differences it has with `lmm.py` is that LMM.setK method signature doesn't include the mixing parameter - its optimal value is searched for automatically.

## Linreg class

Linreg(X).regress(Y) returns residuals, i.e. $ Y - X\beta = Y - XX^\dagger Y $.
Here $ X^\dagger $ is a pseudo-inverse of $ X $ computed by 
[numpy.linalg.pinv](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.pinv.html).

With our definition of the matrix $S$, its effect can be written simply as $SY$.

## LMM class

### setSU_fromK

{% highlight python %}
def setSU_fromK(self):
  N = self.K.shape[0]
  D = self.linreg.D
  ar = np.arange(self.K.shape[0])
  self.K[ar,ar]+=1.0
  K_ = self.linreg.regress(Y=self.K)
  K_ = self.linreg.regress(Y=K_.T)
  [self.S,self.U] = la.eigh(K_)
  self.U = self.U[:,D:N]
  self.S = self.S[D:N] - 1.0
{% endhighlight %}

Here we see that K_ is first set to $S(K+I)$, and then to $S(S(K+I))^T = S(K+I)S\ $ (note that $K$ and $S$ are both symmetric).

Thesis 3.1.1. (Maximum likelihood estimation) contains a reference to the lemma C.15, because
the expression for the likelihood function includes $ S(\gamma K + I) S $.

Lemma C.15 allows to quickly compute eigenpairs of a matrix of this form with any $\gamma$ by considering the matrix
$S(K + I)S$:

> Let $ H_1 $ be defined as $ K + I $ and $ H_γ $ be defined as $ γK + I $, where $ K $ is a
positive semi-definite matrix and $ γ \geq 0 $. 
> Further, let the economy spectral decomposition of $ SH_1S $ be $$ U_S ( \Sigma + I_{N-D} ) U_S^T $$ .
> Then, the economy spectral decomposition of $ SH_γ S $ is given by $$ U (γΣ + I_{N-D} ) U^T $$ , 
> where $ (γΣ + I_{N −D} ) $ is a diagonal matrix holding the
> $ N − D $ non-zero eigenvalues of $ SH_γ S $ and the first $ N − D $ eigenvectors given as columns
> of $ U_S $ are unchanged.

Note that although documentation of [numpy.linalg.eigh](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.eigh.html) suggests that returned eigenvalues are not necessarily ordered, quick check shows that at least in the real-valued case they are sorted in ascending order. That's why last $ N - D $ eigenpairs are taken (first D are zeros).

Thus we conclude that

* self.S corresponds to $\Sigma$;
* self.U holds eigenvectors of $S(K + I)S$ corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues.
